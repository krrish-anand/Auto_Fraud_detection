# ðŸ§  Auto Fraud Detection using Machine Learning        
This project aims to leverage machine learning algorithms to detect fraudulent activities in automobile-related transactions based on behavioral, transactional, and vehicle-related features. The primary goal is to develop an intelligent system that can accurately identify potential frauds in real-time, enabling timely intervention and minimizing financial losses.By analyzing patterns and anomalies in the data, the system can flag suspicious activities such as insurance fraud, odometer tampering, fake claims, or identity misuse. This solution supports insurance companies, dealerships, and regulatory bodies in enhancing trust, efficiency, and security across the automotive ecosystem.
