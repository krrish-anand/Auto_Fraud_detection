# üß† Auto Fraud Detection using Machine Learning        
This project aims to leverage machine learning algorithms to detect fraudulent activities in automobile-related transactions based on behavioral, transactional, and vehicle-related features. The primary goal is to develop an intelligent system that can accurately identify potential frauds in real-time, enabling timely intervention and minimizing financial losses.By analyzing patterns and anomalies in the data, the system can flag suspicious activities such as insurance fraud, odometer tampering, fake claims, or identity misuse. This solution supports insurance companies, dealerships, and regulatory bodies in enhancing trust, efficiency, and security across the automotive ecosystem.

# üí° Problem Statement

With the increasing number of automobile-related transactions, fraudulent activities such as fake insurance claims, odometer rollbacks, and identity misuse are becoming more prevalent. These fraudulent practices not only cause significant financial losses but also erode trust within the automotive and insurance industries. Traditional detection methods are often manual, time-consuming, and prone to error.

Our model aims to bridge this gap by using machine learning to analyze transactional, behavioral, and vehicle-related data to predict and flag potential auto frauds. This system empowers institutions to take proactive, data-driven actions and minimize risks more efficiently and accurately.
